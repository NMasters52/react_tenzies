# 🎲 Tenzies Game

A fun and addictive dice game built with **React** and powered by **Vite**. The goal is to roll all the dice until they match while trying to achieve the **lowest possible roll count**. Try it live: [nmtenzies.netlify.app](https://nmtenzies.netlify.app/)


## 🚀 Features

- **Dice Rolling Mechanic:** Click the dice to hold them, and re-roll the rest until all match.
- **Track Personal Best:** The game saves your best score (lowest count of rolls) using `localStorage`.
- **Responsive Design:** Play the game seamlessly on mobile, tablet, or desktop.
- **Built with Vite:** Enjoy fast build times and optimized performance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite**: A build tool for faster development
- **CSS**: Custom styles for responsive design
- **Netlify**: For deployment and hosting

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Click **Roll** to roll all the dice.
2. Click on a die to "hold" it. Held dice won’t change on subsequent rolls.
3. Keep rolling until all dice display the same number.
4. The fewer rolls it takes to match all the dice, the better!



## 🌐 Deployment

The project is already deployed on **Netlify** at [nmtenzies.netlify.app](https://nmtenzies.netlify.app).
